# sweeftGallery

Simple gallery website which leverages Unsplash API using React Query + Typescript. Working search and history with caching and infinite scrolling. 

## How to run
1. Clone the repository
2. `cd sweeftgallery`
3. `npm install`
4. `npm run dev`

I would never make .env variable public but since it's limited to 50 calls/hour, there's not much to abuse.
